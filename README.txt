This ASCII dungeon crawler was a project I took upon myself over the summer of 2018 between my first and second year.
I think the project captures the essential transition I have taken since I started programming. The game is by no means perfect,
occasionally players encounter errors and the code isn't particularly efficient, this project was part of a larger learning curve
that I undertook.
Being in year two of University now; we haved learned many ways of performing a lot of the activities exercised in this project
in a much more suitable manner, making for a more readable and more efficient outcome. It is highly likely that come the next break
I have, that I may start this project over and utilise some of the many skills that I have learnt this year.
